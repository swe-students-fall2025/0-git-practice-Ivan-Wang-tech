## Reason I Like It
The question of whether AI will replace software engineers has sparked significant debate. After reading “Can AI really code? Study maps the roadblocks to autonomous software engineering,” I believe the demand for software engineers will not decrease but will continue to grow in the future. The article explains that while AI tools are effective at automating repetitive and low-level coding tasks, they do not fully understand human needs, system context, or the creative process of innovation. This reality suggests that engineers will gradually move away from spending time on boilerplate code and will instead focus on defining problems, designing architectures, and developing meaningful solutions.

The study also identifies major challenges. AI generated code is often unreliable and vulnerable to security flaws. Although AI can generate isolated modules, it struggles when working with complex systems that involve multiple components and long term maintenance. These issues show that engineers are still essential as reviewers, problem solvers, and coordinators who ensure that software remains safe, scalable, and aligned with real world requirements.

For computer science students in the 21st century, the message is clear. Education should not only be about learning programming languages but also about developing systematic thinking, abstraction skills, and the ability to apply technology within different social and economic environments. In this way, AI will not replace engineers but will instead free them from repetitive labor so they can focus on creativity, innovation, and building solutions that truly meet human needs.
